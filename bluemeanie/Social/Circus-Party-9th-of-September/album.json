  "description": "The house had a dress up party to see off James (who is going to Canada for a year) and Adam+Cath+Mark (who are going to Yosemite for a month). We also wanted an excuse to juggle knives, juggle clubs, juggle balls, ride unicycles, stilt walk but alas there was no slack lining nor any bouncy castles.",
