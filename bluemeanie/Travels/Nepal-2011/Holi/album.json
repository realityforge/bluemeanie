  "description": "Holi is a festival of color celebrated by the Hindus. \n\nPeople run around throwing colored powder and water at each other. Walking the streets of Kathmandu at this time may mean you are water bombed! However it was mostly the white visitors that kept it going into the afternoon and night. As we were leaving the ext morning and didn't have time to wash before the trek we mostly stayed within our hotel.",
