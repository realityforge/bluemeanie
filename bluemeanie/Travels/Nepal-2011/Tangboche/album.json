  "description": "Tangboche is the major religious center for this region of the Himalaya. The temple as been rebuilt many times and is a testament to the will of the locals. Rob and Ross played soccer with the local monks for a bit but had to retire early - they were downhill and not yet acclimatized. A good laugh for the monks me thinks.",
