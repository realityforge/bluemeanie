  "description": "Ducking under branches and prayer flags, riding on top of a bus with a 700m drop on the left and jungle, villages and waterfalls on the right. This is Nepal.\n\nOur trip to Syabrubesi was certainly exciting. Once we had to get out and walk because it was too exciting for the bus to make it through the land slides.",
