People run around throwing colored powder and water at each other. Walking the streets of Kathmandu at this time may mean you are water bombed! However it was mostly the white visitors that kept it going into the afternoon and night. As we were leaving the ext morning and didn't have time to wash before the trek we mostly stayed within our hotel.">Holi</span></div>

We passed through Namche on the way up the mountain and on the way down. There is pubs, pizza, coffee, tourist shops, gear shops and a market (on the right day). It was probably the most civilized area we found in the Himalaya's.">Namche Bazaar</span></div>

It is a holy site for Buddhists but there also seems to be a lot of Hindu symbology there. Unfortunately there is also lots of shops and stalls at the top of the hill.">Swayambhunath or Monkey Temple</span></div>

      <div class="overlay"><span title="Rest day walk to Thame: Our "rest" day involved walking out towards Thame and back. It was meant to help us acclimatize and to have a rest - turned out to be one of the toughest days we had. We ended up turning back just after Samde and by the time we got back to Namche I had a touch of the altitude sickness.

One of the more interesting places we stopped is the temple at Thamo that the nuns are building. It has taken years and looks like taking years yet. Tibetan monks travel across to continue painting it every year.">Rest day walk to Thame</span></div>

      <div class="overlay"><span title="Namche to Khumjung: There is many ways to get to Khumjung from Namche; We decided to go the hard way over the hill rather than round. The advantage was that we got to see Syangboche - the highest airport in the world (single engine only) and the Everest view - the highest hotel in the world. Many Japanese tourists have the "Himalaya" experience by flying into Syangboche, walking to the Everest view and then staying there a few days. Most (85%) end up with high altitude sickness even when they have pressurized rooms over night.

Khumjung is the home town of our guide and seems to be one of the richer, more educated areas in this part of the world">Namche to Khumjung</span></div>

The temple as been rebuilt many times and is a testament to the will of the locals.
